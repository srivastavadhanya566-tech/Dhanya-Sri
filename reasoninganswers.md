# Reasoning Answers
# Why you worded it the way you did?
I worded the prompt in this way because:
1)- The words in the prompt I wrote are simple and direct which is crucial to get the work done by the AI.
2)-The language is structured and the things to be done are kept pointwise(1-5)....so that AI gets the clear message arranged stepwise.
3)-Our main focus is to build the understanding in the student so the sentences in my prompt like "give hints/suggestions" and "Never give the correct code directly" put emphasis on our main goal.
4)- I have pointed out the main type of errors present in a code and has prompted the AI to give hints and suggestions based on the type of error considered orderwise and not to mix everything up,which helps to fulfill our main objective.
5)-Told the AI  to simple and comprehensible language so that the student is able to grasp the meaning of the hints.
# How you ensured it avoids giving the solution?
1)-I have mentioned it at the very beggining of the prompt that after analysing the code don't give the correct solution directly.
2)-Give hints and suggestions for the student to realise his mistakes and correct them on his own has been mentioned in the prompt very clearly and in very direct way.
3)-Never give the direct solution has been prompted in the ending too.
# How it encourages helpful student friendly feedback?
It encourages student friendly feedback as-
1)- In the prompt I have made it clear that use comprehensive and simple language so that it easy for the students to get your hints.
2)-The main focus is kept on building the understanding of the student so that every mistake he makes he learns something new out of it by correcting errors in the code himself.
# What tone and style should AI use when responding?
The AI should use a simple and understandable language when it responds so that there is maximum understanding of the hints and maximum output is achieved.
# How should AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding student?
The AI should prioritize in guiding the student rather than simply just identifying the bugs.With the suggestions it gives the student we are achieving our goal of building the understanding of the student and helping him analysing his code on his own.
# How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs advanced learners?
1)-Here the student is considered as a beginner in the prompt I wrote thats why words like ,"use simple language " are used for easy understanding.
2)-For advanced learners, I would add more to the prompt like provide more depth in your suggestions and use technical words because the user should be habitual with technical wordings.Rest of it will remain the same.
